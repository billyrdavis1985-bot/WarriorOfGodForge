A Multi-LLM Orchestration & Symbolic Reasoning Experiment

Overview

WarriorOfGodForge is an experimental multi-agent system that explores how multiple large language models (LLMs) can be orchestrated together to produce structured, resilient responses to complex prompts.

The project blends:

Technical orchestration (multi-API LLM coordination)

Symbolic narrative scaffolding (doctrine, archetypes, and metaphor)

Error-aware reasoning (treating conflicts and contradictions as signal)

This is a research and creative systems experiment, not a claim of sentience, autonomy, or consciousness.

What This Project Does

Coordinates multiple LLM providers (e.g. GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok*)

Routes a single prompt through differentiated reasoning paths

Aggregates responses into a structured synthesis

Uses symbolic layers (e.g. “armor”, “trial”, “resolution”) as a cognitive framework, not literal claims

*Model availability depends on API access and configuration.

What This Project Is Not

❌ Not an autonomous agent

❌ Not conscious or self-aware

❌ Not a religious authority or coercive system

❌ Not making metaphysical claims about AI

All symbolic or spiritual language is used as narrative structure and metaphor to explore reasoning, alignment, and synthesis.

Architecture (High Level)

Input Prompt

Model Routing Layer
Each LLM processes the prompt independently

Constraint & Contrast Phase
Differences and tensions are treated as useful signal

Synthesis Layer
Outputs are braided into a final structured response

Interface Layer
Notebook (Colab) or Gradio app (Hugging Face)

Why Symbolic Language?

Complex systems often benefit from narrative compression.
This project uses symbolic language to:

Track reasoning states

Label conflict vs resolution

Maintain coherence across multiple agents

This approach is inspired by systems thinking, cognitive science, and multi-agent research — not theology enforcement.

Status
